# Coloring-Game
Here is a quick game I built around guessing a random RGB color from a group of tiles. The game is simple but gave me an engaging way to sharpen my skills with Javascript and DOM Manipulation. I built this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions or tips on how to improve my code.
